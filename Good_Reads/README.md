# Pandas

The project in this folder was an assignment completed for The George Washington University Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.

`GoodReads.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook file that utilzes the Pandas Library to read in a csv file and transforms the data by altering the column names. And exporting the dataframe to a new csv file.

`GoodReadsSummary.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook file that reads in the csv created in `GoodReads.ipynb`. The Pandas Library is then used to calculate summary information about the set of books.
