The project in this folder was an assignment completed for The George Washington University Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.

`SearchForTheWorst.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook that uses the Pandas Library to read in a csv file of soccer information. The data is then transformed to assist in identifying the strikers that are worst at their position.
